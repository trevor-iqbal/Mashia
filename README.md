# Mashia

Mashia is a health monitering system designed for cattle. This project is basically my final year project where the task was to make a contact-less health monitering system for cattle through computer vision. In order to understand the entire project in simple terms look at the figure below

Sensors are planted in dairy farms at certain positions which capture readings of each individual cow and upload in realtime to the cloud. The readings are further processed and are fetched to the mobile application indicating health stat of each cow in farm. If an animal starts to show abnormal signs of health behaviour then that animal is moved towards critical section which would allow the caretaker of the farm to separate the animal in critical health from the others in order to stop spreading of diseases into other animals. The inspiration behind building this entire setup is to provide a cheaper alternative than the other moderately expensive cattle health monitering systems.
Now moving on to the features within the app see the images below

The backend of the project was made using Nodejs(Express) and all reading which are visible in the app are stored in MongoDB Atlas. In order to test the project you can use dummy account credentials to login.

The project is still in work in progress and more features will be added in future.
